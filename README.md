### My builds

> Looking at this you may think "It doesn't make sense to go through the trouble of self-hosting all of this".
> You are right. It clearly does not if you want to ship fast, but it is great if you just want to have fun and learn how everything works :)

  - Self-hosted infrastructure:
      - Traefik: reverse proxy (I use multiple domains under a single IP address) and automated SSL certificates renewal
      - [My own DDNS system](https://github.com/Pablo-Davila/spaceship-ddns) _(given that Spaceship only provides an API)_
      - My portfolio _(it dates back to year 2 at uni, but you can play [tetris](https://pablodavila.eu/games/tetris/)!)_
      - Telegram bots (more on this later)
      - Look Ahead services (more on this later)
      - All the above runs using Docker
  - Look Ahead (development paused): A platform to provide information to students about grants, free courses, internships and other opportunities
      - I played backend while a friend worked on the frontend
      - [API](https://api.pablodavila.eu/docs) (Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy and Google OAuth) _(pre-alpha version)_
      - SQL database
      - A cronjob for DB backups
      - [A Telegram channel](https://t.me/lookahead_oportunidades) with over 650 followers
  - Telegram bots (Python + Docker):
      - [MyElizaPsychologistBot](https://t.me/MyElizaPsychologistBot) ([source](https://github.com/Pablo-Davila/MyElizaPsychologistBot))
      - [TasksListsBot](https://t.me/TasksListsBot) ([source](https://github.com/Pablo-Davila/TasksListsBot))
      - [TrainCounterBot](https://t.me/TrainCounterBot) ([source](https://github.com/Pablo-Davila/TrainCounterBot))
  - [A certificates generator](https://pablodavila.eu/project.html?name=certificatesGenerator)
  - Ad-hoc web scrapers (Python + BeautifulSoup / Selenium)
